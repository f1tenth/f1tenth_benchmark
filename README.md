# f1tenth_benchmark

Questions:
- how to switch between different maps? 
- need help in other tasks to have a second opinion on design
- logging, what do we want to log? entire rollouts -> easy replay, but large files.
- how to serialize the data? the agent configuration, map, raceline?
- for control task: we dont want to simulate collision with the wall, either create white map (which raceline), or disable collision checks
